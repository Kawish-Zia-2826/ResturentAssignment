        Seekh Kebab, These melt in mouth kebab made with chicken mince, onions, ginger, garlic, butter & spices is packed with delicious flavours just like my Galouti Kebab. The kebab is juicy, relatively easy to make and cooks faster. You can serve them with hot parathas and green chutney for a filling meal.</p>
