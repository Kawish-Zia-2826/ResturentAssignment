Ready for a smokey succulent authentic Pakistani chicken tikka? It tastes just like a restaurant and as if just coming off the barbecue pit. Marinate tikka ahead and cook it within 25 minutes!

Chicken tikka leg and breast served on a plater with sauces in the background.
This is one of the most tested recipes on the blog. The tandoori chicken is often referred to as Chicken Tikka Thigh or Breast in Pakistan.

So if the bone in the version of tandoori chicken is called chicken tikka in Pakistan then what is the boneless chicken tikka version called? It is called Chicken tikka boti or Chicken tikka kabab.</p>
